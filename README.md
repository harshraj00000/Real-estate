- Lot size
- Floors

- View quality
- Property condition
- Grade
- Year built and year renovated
- Zipcode
- Latitude and longitude

- Perform statistical analyses or build predictive models.

# Data Description

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features. Cleaned and preprocessed data is available in the dataset file.

# Data Visualization
